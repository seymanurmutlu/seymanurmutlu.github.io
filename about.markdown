I’m Şeyma Nur Mutlu. I’m a senior Computer Engineering student at Kocaeli University. I am enthusiast about algorithms, cybersecurity, data science. My aim is to improve my analysis, coding skills and cybersecurity knowledge, and to learn new approaches to analytics.

Junior computer engineering students and cs newbies ask me a lot about programming quizzes. I created this page to gather all questions here and share them in a more understandable way. I wrote these codes when I was a junior student. Feel free to contribute.
